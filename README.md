# A Cloud Native Oauth2 Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure 


EPIC and Benefit hypothesis

As an organisation I distribute my ressource and API to my partner so that only them can access to the ressource I am distributing


### Feature1 : Authorization server
Key principle: and client application (e.g. Micro-service instead of sending their client client_id and client_secret the resource it wants to access, request it through 
a third-party server.

Feature2 : Authentication server
Feature3 : Ressource server
